<h5 align=center>Syngonium</h5>
<p><blockquote>Flowering tropical plant family with many distinct and beautiful varities for indoor decoration.

<h5 align=center>Marantaceae</h5>
<p><blockquote>Also known as arrowroots, these plants are known for their movement throughout the day as they follow the light. Due to their high movement and how the plant may stretch its leaves upwards, these plants are also known as prayer plants. They require high humidity and are known for being very fussy and not beginner friendly. They are easy to overwater, but absolutely loathe being dried out, so they are not recommended for new growers. There are many species and varieties to choose from when you embark upon the journey of growing these plants.<br>

<h5 align=center>Monstera</h5>
<p><blockquote>These large tropical plants typically grow around large trees, and have become very popular in the plant trade. Growing enormous leaves in the wild, allowing these plants to flourish in the home properly can be difficult, but even though they come from tropical conditions, they are easy to care for indoors for beginners, but quite difficult to master. Their leaves form fenestrations, or holes, which either protect them from high hurricane winds or allow light to filter to smaller leaves below, but these leaves are considered extremely beautiful in the modern plant trade. There are several expensive varieties, some fetching thousands of dollars on the market.<br>
  <h3>Varieties</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>Adansonii</li>
        <li>Borsigniana</li>
        <li>Deliciosa</li>
        <li>Obliqua</li>
        <li>Variegata</li>
