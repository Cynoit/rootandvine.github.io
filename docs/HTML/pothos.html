<strong><span class="resort">About the Pothos</span></strong><p>A vining plant that originated in French Polynesia and became naturalized in tropical regions around the world, this beginner-friendly plant is now a popular houseplant. <br><br> Called "Pothos" by plant enthusiasts, it has many colloquial names such as "devil's ivy", earned because it is very hard to kill. Due to how resilliant it is, and its vining nature, the Pothos has caused severe ecological damage in some areas, choking out native plants and becoming an invasive threat. <br><br> Your Pothos should never be planted outside, and care should be taken with any cuttings.</p></blockquote>
